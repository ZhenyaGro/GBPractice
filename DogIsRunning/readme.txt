We have 2 humans (friend 1, friend 2). They are moving toward each other with different speeds.
There is a dog. It's running between the friends. From the friend 1 to the friend 2.
When the dog reaches one of friends it immediately returns to the second one.
The dog also has some speed.
Question: Before friends meet, how many times will the dog run between friends?
